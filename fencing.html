        <p>THE BEGINNING OF JAMEER'S FENCING STORY:</p>
        <hr>
        <p>Jameer's fencing story began at the age of 12 for the Peter Westbrook Foundation, which is a not-for-profit organization that uses the sport </p> 
        <p>of fencing to enrich the lives of young people from underserved communities in the New York Metropolitan Area. At first, Jameer didn't really</p>
        <p>like practicing fencing or even going to the Peter Westbrook Foundation but, he slowly started to like it over time. In the beginning of the</p>
        <p>2019-20 fencing season, Jameer started going to Thrust Fencing Academy, located in Nyack, NY, who Jameer is trained by Mika'il Sankofa, a</p>
        <p>three time sabre olympian for the US. During this time, Jameer was training for fencing more than he did the following season and slowly and </p>
        <p>started competively fencing during Feburary of 2020 where he competed in his first competition. 
        Despite all of this, Jameer was still pretty 
        <p>bad at the sport and had to train and do more work to get better.</p>

    <p>THE PRESENT STORY OF JAMEER'S FENCING CAREER:</p>
    <hr>
    <p>Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Jameer's mother wouldn't allow Jameer to play basketball with his friends and would only allow Jameer to</p>
    <p>go to fencing practice. This opened up a brand new opportunity for Jameer. Starting in September of 2020, Jameer would go onto practice </p> 
    <p>fencing from Tuesday to Saturday almost every week at his club and would slowly start to get better and eventually, getting caught up to all</p>
    <p>of the other kids that were around his age category. During the spring of 2021, Jameer started loving the sport so much that he eventually </p>
    <p>quit basketball, a sport that Jameer had been playing for his entire life, and started to go to a lot of competitions. Unexpectedly, on the first </p>
    <p>day of May, Jameer qualified for his first fencing nationals for Y-14, and about three weeks later, he did the same thing but this time for DIV2 </p>
    <p>and DIV3. But as soon as Jameer was going beyond his limits and catching fire, Jameer unfortunatly suffered a severe left-hamstring</p>
    <p>sprain which destroyed his confidence physically and mentally, and he was also not performing the same as he was prior to the hamstring sprain.</p>
    <p>But that did not matter to Jameer. Despite the left-hamstring sprain, Jameer continuted to practice, getting ready to compete at his first </p>
    <p>national event. During the national event, Jameer did not do well in his three events. Currenly, Jameer took some time off to rest his injury </p>
    and is training to strengthen his hamstring. Jameer is looking forward to starting off strong for the 2021-22 season. </p>
